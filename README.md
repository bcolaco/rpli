# About

rpli stands for RPL Interpreter. It is and interpreter for the [Responsys Personalization Language](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/marketing/responsys-develop/RPL/Intro.htm).

# Motivation

Because the only way (as far as I know) to run RPL is using a production instance of Responsys, this tool intends to run RPL code locally for debugging and testing purposes.
